## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The following packages were installed:
Python
Spark
Psypark
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

At the present time, a lot of corporates moved their business model from a one-time fee to a monthly or annual subscription. The customers do have several options and have right to call-off their subscription at any point in time or in some cases, lower to the free subscription model. At the same time, some of the companies need to keep their customers at the paid level. It is pertient at this point to assess/predict the churn out of the consumers in almost every industry.

In this project, I'd used Spark ML programming to analyze consumers log activity dataset and build a machine learning model to identify consumers who are most likely to churn from the music app (Sparkify).
